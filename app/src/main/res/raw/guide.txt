Thank you for downloading SkinBread.
This application allows you to view skins for Minecraft from various services.

The following sources are currently supported:
* Local storage
* Vanilla skin system
* 5ZigReborn
* Cloaks+
* ely.by
* GeyserMC
* LabyMod
* LiquidBounce
* Mantle
* Meteor
* MinecraftCapes
* Optifine
* TLauncher
* Wurst
* Wynntils

To download your skins, use FETCH button, and to open them from local storage, use LOCAL.

Essentially, the app collects skin elements (ears, cape, skin) from sources selected in the *sources list* and displays them on the 3D model. You can *change the order* to determine which skins are prioritized.

I hope my app will be useful to you!
